The London Clojurians are happy to present:

== Debugging and exploring Clojure applications with FlowStorm

Juan Monetta (https://github.com/jpmonettas) will be presenting:
"Debugging and exploring Clojure applications with FlowStorm"

FlowStorm (https://github.com/jpmonettas/flow-storm-debugger) allows
you to instrument and run any Clojure codebase so it traces everything
it is doing. See how these traces can be used to debug and understand
Clojure code.

Juan has been working as a programmer since late 90s, and working
professionally as a Clojure developer since 2011 over many domains.
He has a passion for dev tooling and anything that makes writing
software more fun.
