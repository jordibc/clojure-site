re:Clojure is a community-driven effort to bring together
knowledgeable speakers to present new and exciting topics on all
things Clojure and ClojureScript.

This year, like last year, the conference
will be held online, on the 2nd and 3rd of December 2022. You are
cordially invited to come along, listen, participate and perhaps learn
one or two new things along the way.

For further details, including the speakers/schedule/instructions and
how to attend, please visit https://www.reclojure.org/[re:Clojure]. You can
also pop along to our https://discord.gg/GJ4hkbWgjF[Discord
server] to speak to any of the organisers and fellow Clojurians.

We look forward to seeing you there!
