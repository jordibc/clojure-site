&quot;Betting your company on Lisp: 5 years with Clojure in production&quot; +
Functional Programming is sold as a silver bullet, yet many +
organizations lack real-world experience with the paradigm at +
scale. How well does functional programming work in practice? What +
happens when you bet your company on a functional programming language like Clojure? In this talk, Adam shares his experience from building the CodeScene tool and how the FP hype transferred into real +
productivity gains and cheaper maintenance. +
Adam Tornhill is a programmer who combines degrees in engineering and +
psychology. He&rsquo;s the founder of CodeScene, the leading Software +
Engineering Intelligence tool. Adam is also the author of multiple +
technical books, including the best-selling Your Code as a Crime +
Scene. Adam&rsquo;s other interests include modern history, music, retro +
computing, and martial arts. +
