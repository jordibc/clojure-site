Mauricio Szabo (https://github.com/mauricioszabo/) will be presenting: +
&quot;Lisp curse vs Lisp envy&quot; +
We sometimes say &quot;this doesn't exist in Clojure because of the Lisp +
Curse&quot;, or blame it for some other lack of &quot;mature libraries&quot;. In this +
talk, we will revisit the idea of what the &quot;curse&quot; is, and what +
other &quot;curses&quot; we have on other communities, to conclude if what we +
have is a &quot;bug&quot; or a &quot;feature&quot;. +
Mauricio is a Clojure and ClojureScript developer, author of Chlorine, +
Clover, Spock some other libraries; He calls himself a &quot;test-freak&quot;, +
he like motorcycles and windsurf, and a lot of other random things +
too. +
