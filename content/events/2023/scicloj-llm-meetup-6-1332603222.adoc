 +
On the next meetup of the Scicloj LLM series, we will keep exploring the LLMOps platform Bosquet. +
In this meeting, the author Å½ygimantas Medelis will demonstrate how Bosquet can be used to implement a couple of workflows presented in recent research. You may see examples of such implementations in Bosquet&rsquo;s documentation. +
