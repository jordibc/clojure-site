Adrian Smith (https://github.com/phronmophobic) will be presenting: +
&quot;Simpler User Interfaces with Membrane&quot; +
User Interfaces are brittle, highly coupled, and inflexible. This talk +
will diagnose some of the root problems that plague user interfaces +
and show how a different approach can make UI programs dramatically +
simpler using Membrane (https://github.com/phronmophobic/membrane). +
Adrian is a software engineer and creator of membrane, a UI library +
that runs anywhere. He got started programming by making tic-tac-toe +
for his TI-83 calculator. Since then, he's built web, mobile, and +
desktop apps using python, javascript, ruby, php, objective-c, and c++ +
before finally finding clojure. He believes that programming should be +
for everyone and that you shouldn't need a CS degree to make a simple +
web, desktop, or mobile app. The right tools for making programming +
accessible don't exist... yet, but he's working to change that. +
