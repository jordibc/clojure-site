Tony Kay (github.com/awkay) will be presenting: +
&quot;Software Development Leverage&quot; +
This talk is about Tony's experiments and experiences around the issue +
of efficient and sustainable software development that have led to +
open source libraries such as Fulcro, Fulcro RAD, Guardrails, and +
more. It briefly explores what led to his choice of Clojure and the +
design decisions in his open-source work, and how those things have +
evolved through success and failure. +
Tony has been a professional software developer for more than 3 +
decades, with interests that have ranged from operating system +
internals to language processing, and he has mainly worked with (or +
co-owned) companies in the early phases of development. In the past +
decade he has had an increased interest in how software development +
succeeds or fails as a human endeavor. He spends a lot of his spare +
time hiking in forested and alpine areas of the Pacific Northwest in +
the United States, and has interests in perennial food systems, soil +
science, and regenerative agriculture. +
