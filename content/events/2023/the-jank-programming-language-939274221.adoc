The London Clojurians are happy to present: +
Title: **The jank programming language** +
Speaker: **Jeaye Wilkerson** +
Time: **2023-06-13 @ 18:30 (London time)** +
Local time: https://time.is/1830_13_June_2023_in_London/ (click here for local time) +
Jeaye Wilkerson (https://github.com/jeaye) will be presenting: +
&quot;The jank programming language&quot; +
jank (https://jank-lang.org/) is a Clojure dialect on LLVM with C++ interop. In this talk, Jeaye will cover jank's use cases, some challenges around building a native Clojure dialect, and some insights about Clojure itself found only by spelunking deep into the Clojure compiler. +
Jeaye has a background in C++ systems programming, focusing on games +
and game engines. After several years of that, he co-founded an +
e-sports tournament startup written in full-stack Clojure for another +
5 years. These days, he&rsquo;s at Electronic Arts (EA) building tooling +
used to make some of the world&rsquo;s top games. +
