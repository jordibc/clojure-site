== Webinar: The Xiana Framework for Clojure

This webinar will give a solid intro to Xiana! Xiana is a lightweight web-application framework written in Clojure, for Clojure. The goal is to be simple, fast, and most importantly - a welcoming platform for web programmers with different backgrounds who want to experience the wonders of functional programming! +
It's easy to install, fun to experiment with, and a powerful tool to produce monolithic web applications. +
This session will cover what it is, its core concepts, its architecture overview, and how to set up a project using Xiana. +
