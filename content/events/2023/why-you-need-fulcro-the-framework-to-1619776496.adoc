Title: Why you need Fulcro, the web framework to build apps better, faster +
Speaker: Jakub Hol&yacute; +
Time: 2023-07-11 @ 18:30 (London time) +
Local time: https://time.is/1830_11_July_2023_in_London/ (click here for local time) +
Jakub Hol&yacute; (https://holyjak.cz/) will be presenting: +
&quot;Why you need Fulcro, the web framework to build apps better, faster&quot; +
Fulcro (https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro) is my web framework of +
choice whenever I need to create any non-trivial web application +
thanks to its productivity. Its overarching design goal is sustainable +
development speed as time goes and code grows and it really shows +
up. It is developer friendly, with minimal boilerplate, and features +
you need for any serious application. And it is surprisingly +
flexible. Fulcro is based on a few simple ideas that combine +
powerfully to produce a multitude of capabilities, including its Rapid +
Application Development &quot;add-on&quot;. Some people find Fulcro complicated +
and scary - but it doesn't need to be. Stop choosing &quot;simpler&quot; web +
frameworks - and ending up implementing half of Fulcro with much more +
effort and verbosity and much less value. I will present the +
minimalist way of learning Fulcro with its three corner stones and +
explain Fulcro's building blocks. After this talk, you will understand +
the design and value of Fulcro, be motivated to learn it, and equipped +
to do so quickly. +
Jakub has been developing enterprise software since 2005, fell in love +
with Clojure in 2012, and with Fulcro in 2020. He cares deeply about +
productivity (and thus Clojure, DevOps, and Fulcro) and quality and +
enjoys sharing his discoveries and thoughts on his blog. Aside of his +
daily job, he also mentors and pair-programs with Fulcro beginners. He +
comes from the Czech Republic and lives currently in Norway. +
