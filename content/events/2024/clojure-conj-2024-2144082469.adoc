== Clojure/Conj 2024

Clojure/conj is the oldest gathering of the Clojure community, and the next edition will be October 23-25, 2024, in Alexandria, VA, at the George Washington Masonic Memorial. The Conj is a great place to learn about the most exciting developments in the Clojure ecosystem and talk to a wide range of Clojure users. +
 +
Oct 25th will be Community Day, and we will include the Clojure community via streaming and remote participation. We encourage local Clojure communities to plan a gathering on this day and look forward to finding ways to share this day with a global audience. +
