Welcome to Clojure!

This guide is a gentle introduction to the basics of Clojure and links out to other references and resources if you want more detail. These pages are intended to be read in order and may build upon material from prior pages. Each page has a few exercises provided at the bottom of the page.

== Contents

* <<syntax#,Syntax>>
* <<functions#,Functions>>
* <<sequential_colls#,Sequential Collections>>
* <<hashed_colls#,Hashed Collections>>
* <<flow#,Flow Control>>
* <<namespaces#,Namespaces>>

This guide is a work in progress and more pages will be added in the future!
