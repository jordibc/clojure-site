Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

Several highlights to point out this week:

* Thanks to the persistent efforts of Rob Stuttaford and the generosity of Slack, the Clojurians Slack channel now has a https://twitter.com/stewart/status/1466843623266283521[Pro account]!
* https://twitter.com/NYSE/status/1468747415750598665[Nubank is now listed as NU on the NYSE] - fun to see Clojure devs at a bell ringing!
* Clojure users https://www.wraltechwire.com/2021/12/09/durham-startup-kevel-raises-10m-plans-to-hire-more-workers-in-2022/[Kevel] (formerly Adzerk) raised $10M and are planning to do more hiring!
* Daniel Slutsky https://clojureverse.org/t/rethinking-community-scope/[posted a request for discussion] on extending the great work the SciCloj folks have been doing around teaching and learning to the broader Clojure community

== In the core

This week has been a bit scattered, but we continue to work through some tickets related to the (soon to be) clojure.math. I want to especially thank Paula Gearon for all of the work she's done lately to create https://github.com/quoll/cljs-math[a CLJS port of the ns] so that we can have a great portable math library.
