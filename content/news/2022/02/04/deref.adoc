Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

This week we released https://clojure.org/releases/devchangelog#v1.11.0-beta1[Clojure 1.11.0-beta1] which we consider feature complete for 1.11. From this point forward we are ramping down to a final release and if you have not yet tested any of the Clojure 1.11 alphas, we would greatly appreciate it if you tested your app/lib with beta1 and let us know if you find anything amiss at https://ask.clojure.org. Thanks!
