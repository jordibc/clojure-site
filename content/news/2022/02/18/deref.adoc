Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

The big news this week is the release of Clojure 1.11.0-rc1 - read the full https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/changes.md#changes-to-clojure-in-version-1110[1.11 changelog] for the details.
