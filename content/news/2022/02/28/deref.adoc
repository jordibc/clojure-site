Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

The https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/clojure2022[State of Clojure 2022 Survey] is now open! We're getting a bit of a late start this year but now is the time to chip in and let us know how things are going. As always, we are are trying to get a good sampling of the community and it doesn't take long to complete, so your input is much appreciated.

Cognitect and Nubank are now supporting https://github.com/sponsors/dmiller[David Miller], who has been the maintainer of ClojureCLR for many years. He has ambitious plans for a significant rewrite of the project - please check him out if you want to sponsor that work as well.
