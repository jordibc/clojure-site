Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

The big news this week is of course the https://clojure.org/news/2022/03/22/clojure-1-11-0[Clojure 1.11 release]! We are really happy this is now out there and available. It seems like people are enjoying a lot of the new functions available. Please drop any questions or issues at https://ask.clojure.org[ask.clojure.org].

We also saw the launch this week of https://theclouncil.com/[The Clouncil], a new interactive Clojure show for beginners - it was a lot of fun.

Also I wanted to highlight Daniel Higginbotham's post https://jobs-blog.braveclojure.com/2022/03/24/long-term-clojure-benefits.html[Learning Clojure yields surprising long-term benefits. These companies are hiring and will train you.] which is does a great job highlighting some benefits of Clojure.
