Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== From the core

I mentioned back in the https://clojure.org/news/2022/04/01/deref[April 1st Deref] that we'd had a couple reports with 1.11 where Clojure code compiled with a prior version of Clojure with functions overlapping newly added functions in 1.11 had failed when run without recompilation on 1.11. (Notably, this is not a new issue, just one we are seeing now by adding a function name `abs` in clojure.core that is relatively common.) Recompiling is sufficient to get past the issue, but we want to actually fix this problem for future releases. Fogus has spent a couple weeks now diving into the details and it mostly centers around `refer` and some subtle differences in ordering behavior between AOT compiled Clojure and loaded Clojure source. There have been several changes over the life of Clojure trying to address these differences, but I'm convinced we did not truly understand the problem in most of those cases and created workarounds instead of actual fixes. Anyhow, Fogus is continuing to work on this.

Among other things, I've been most recently looking into the reducibility and iterability of seqs over persistent collections. In most cases, these (unnecessarily) lose the context of their original (immutable) source. I've done an exhaustive review of this and I'm working towards a tidy set of improvements that should benefit `reduce` (and things built on `reduce` like `into`, `transduce`, etc) in a lot of cases. Hope to have a public ticket and patch for this work soon.
