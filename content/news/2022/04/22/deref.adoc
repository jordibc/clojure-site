Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

This week we saw the launch of https://github.com/Tensegritics/ClojureDart[ClojureDart]! Very excited to see people starting to explore it and to spread our Clojure tendrils ever farther. Big congrats to Christophe Grand and Baptiste Dupuch for getting it out the door.

Also it was great to see the https://clojured.de/schedule/[clojureD 2022 schedule] posted and it's already sold out! It is really good to see the slow return to in-person conferences where we can meet other Clojurists.
