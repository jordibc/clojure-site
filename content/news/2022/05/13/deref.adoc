Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

The https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/05/11/stack-overflow-2022-developer-survey-is-open/[Stack Overflow 2022 Developer Survey] is open now. If you have a few minutes, completing this is really important to maintain's Clojure visibility. In the past Clojure has been noted in this survey for its comparatively high pay and experience levels compared to other languages. If you use one of the Clojure datalog databases, make sure to write that in in the Databases section too!
