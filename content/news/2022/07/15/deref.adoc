Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

The https://clojuredays.org/[Dutch Clojure Day] will return on Oct 29th in Amsterdam - check out the https://sessionize.com/dutch-clojure-days-2022/[CFP] and https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/dutch-clojure-day-2022-tickets-380638669507[registration].

We've seen a number of questions about the Clojure/conj and a group has been working on developing a plan. It looks like we probably will not have an event this year but are looking at dates in spring 2023, mostly likely in the Durham, NC area. We hope to have a firm date in the near future.

Clojurists Together has opened https://www.clojuriststogether.org/open-source/[funding applications] for the next round of funding. Get your projects in!

The Sci Cloj has been hard at work starting some new courses and groups - check out  https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/ds4clj/[ds4clj: a data science course for Clojure devs] and https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/jointprob/[jointprob: a probabilistic modelling and Bayesian statistics study group].
