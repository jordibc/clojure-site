Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

The Deref has been on summer vacation but we are back!

It was great to see the announcement that https://www.reclojure.org/[reClojure] is returning as an online event from Dec 2-3 with a focus on Clojure Growth. I like the sound of that!

As mentined a couple weeks back, we are close to finalizing the dates for the next Clojure/conj so watch this space but currently we are looking at late April 2023.
