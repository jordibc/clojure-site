Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

Looking to the future, the https://sessionize.com/reclojure-2022/[reClojure Call for Speakers] is happening now until Oct 9th! Get those talks in. Also, the keynotes will be James Gosling, who designed and implemented the first version of Java, and Alex Miller (hey, that's me) from the Clojure core team. I am looking forward to this event in December.

Looking to the past, check out the https://clojured.de/media/videos/videos-2022/[:clojureD Videos 2022] from earlier this year.

And in the almost present, the Deref will be on "conference vacation" next week due to Strange Loop.
