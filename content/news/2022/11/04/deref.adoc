Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

Last week the Clojure team gathered for a round table discussion celebrating the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exSRG-iL74Q[15th anniversary of Clojure] - check it out and have a piece of cake at home! Thanks for being part of the community. It is amazing to me that every single week when I go to make this Deref there are dozens of new blogs, videos, and library releases to share!

I also wanted to highlight Jacek Schae's latest effort, the https://clojure.stream/workshops[ClojureStream workshops]. Looks like some great ideas there and an excellent way to learn some new Clojure skills.
