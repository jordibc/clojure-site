Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

Today we finalized the Clojure/conj 2023 program and notified speakers. We had 100 talks submitted and accepted 23, but we easily could have accepted 70 or 80 of those talks - there were so many interesting experience reports, libraries, and ideas included that we wish we could have included more of them. Please keep submitting these talks to other Clojure and non-Clojure confs in the future! We will start to release the program and more info in the next week or two.
