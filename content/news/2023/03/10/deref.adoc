Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

The https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/clojure2023[State of Clojure 2023 Survey] is still open and we would very much like to hear your opinions! We've been doing this survey every year since 2010 and it's been very important for tracking trends in the community.
