Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== From the core

As I've mentioned a few times in various places, I've been working on bringing the long awaited `add-libs` functionality for dynamically adding libs at runtime to Clojure proper in the context of the next Clojure 1.12 alpha. Working through one last (I hope) round of feedback on that but that should be coming soon. As support work for that, we will also be adding some new APIs for accessing the tools.deps runtime basis (basically what libs you're using), a Java Process API, and an api for invoking tools via the Clojure CLI. There is some expanded support for function execution already in the current CLI that I will be documenting as well.

Fogus has been mostly focusing on some new tooling derived from REBL and we are hopefully nearing a point of release on that and some additional supporting libs soon as well.

The Clojure survey closed recently and as soon as we can get a writeup done and reviewed we will publish those results.

https://2023.clojure-conj.org/[Clojure/conj 2023] is coming in one month! Get your https://ti.to/cognitect/clojureconj-2023[in-person or streaming tickets] and join us for a couple days packed with Clojure goodness. Can't wait to see you all.
