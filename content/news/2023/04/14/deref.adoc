Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

The big highlight today is the release of https://clojure.org/news/2023/04/14/clojure-1-12-alpha2[Clojure 1.12.0-alpha2] which focuses on the new `add-lib` functions. This has been work in progress on top of tools.deps for several years, and it's gone through many different approaches before we ended here. We are interested in your feedback on this and I expect there will be some further updates before we reach the final 1.12 release. Also check the full list of https://clojure.org/releases/devchangelog#v1.12.0-alpha2[changes] in alpha2.

We are also working on some additional Java interop features and bug fixes which are still targeted for 1.12.
