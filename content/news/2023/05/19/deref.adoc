Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

As we approach about 2 years of doing the Deref, I think it has become a useful weekly signal of what's going on in the Clojure world and I spend about an hour or so making it each week. It occurs to me that maybe some helpful person in the community would be interested in doing (or automating) the link collection work. If you'd be interested in doing this, drop me a line on Clojurians slack in #clojure-dev.
