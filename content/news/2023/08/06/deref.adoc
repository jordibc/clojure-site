Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem (feed: https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS]). Thanks to Anton Fonarev for link aggregation.

== From the core

As https://clojure.org/news/2023/08/04/next-rich[posted on Friday], Rich has retired from Nubank but continues to set the direction and work on Clojure. We are very happy to see Rich get the retirement he deserves after many years of creating so many amazing projects - Clojure, Datomic, edn, transit, Codeq, REBL, and more. There are no end of ideas we've talked about and some of them may be more possible now than ever.

Things will be a little different for us in how we work but we expect to continue to regularly develop and release new versions of Clojure much as we have for many years. We are hard at work trying to complete the remaining dev work for Clojure 1.12 and I expect we will have a feature complete alpha pretty soon, and then start the rampdown to release.
